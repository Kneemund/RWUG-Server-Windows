## RWUG Server for Windows

A UDP server for the Wii U GamePad, which emulates a controller and is written in C++ for Windows. \
Running the [client](https://github.com/Kneemund/RWUG-Client) requires a jailbroken Wii U with Homebrew.

This server relies on ViGEmBus, a driver for emulating controllers. It can be downloaded and installed from [here](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases).
